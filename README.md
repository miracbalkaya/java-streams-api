# Java Streams API
is a powerful feature introduced in Java 8 that enables developers to process collections of objects in a more concise, expressive, and parallelized manner. It provides a set of functional-style operations that can be applied to collections of objects, including arrays, lists, and sets.

Streams are a sequence of elements that can be processed in parallel or sequentially. The Stream API provides a set of intermediate and terminal operations that can be used to filter, transform, and aggregate data. The intermediate operations return a new stream, while the terminal operations return a result or a side-effect.

# Course Description
Functional programming is becoming very popular and it focuses around pure functions. Functional applications avoid the shared state, and tend to be more concise and predictable than those using object-oriented code. In this course Mira√ß will teach you how to move away from imperative to declarative programming allowing you to write less code and focus on what is important when build applications.
